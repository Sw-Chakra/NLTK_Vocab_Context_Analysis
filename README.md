# NLTK_Vocab_Context_Analysis
You shall know a word by the company it keeps.

The large number of English words can make language-based applications daunting. To cope with this, it is
helpful to have a clustering or embedding of these words, so that words with similar meanings are clustered
together, or have embeddings that are close to one another.

Words that tend to appear in similar contexts are likely to be related. In this Project, we would
investigate this idea by coming up with an embedding of words that is based on co-occurrence statistics.
